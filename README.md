## Hi there 👋
</div>
I am a Korean student living in France, studying programming and software development at École 42. École 42 provides a self-directed learning environment where I am building my skills through peer learning and project-based education. I am currently learning various programming languages, algorithms, and data structures, with a particular focus on C and C++.
